            <p>The days of plotting rates on semi-log graph paper are long gone. 
              In the industry, commercial software programs are used with extensive 
              database capabilities to quickly develop forecasts. In general, 
              the exponential decline is the most commonly used method. Perhaps 
              in the beginning, it was as matter of convenience. Today, with everyone 
              using software generated decline curves, all methods are equally 
              convenient. </p>
            <p>The graph below shows all three decline equations fit nearly exactly 
              to the first 2 years, and produce noticeably different forecasts. 
              If all three decline equations match the historical data, then the 
              exponential decline forecast will show the most decline in rates, 
              hence provide the most conservative forecast. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="./Traditional Decline Curve Analysis_files/decline curve- exponential case.jpg" width="450" height="265"></p>
            <p>Conservative forecasts are probably most appropriate in the early 
              stages of production where there are more unquantifiable factors 
              that tend to reduce the field rate rather than increase them in 
              the future. This includes down time related to facility and well 
              maintenance. Secondly, if the decline curve analysis is to be used 
              for reserves calculations, the forecast needs reflect a "reasonable 
              certainty" standard. </p>
            <p>The hyperbolic curve requires estimation of both Di and the exponent 
              "b." Hyperbolic decline curves have been used in many 
              cases, particularly in the late history of pressure supported production. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the cumulative recovery should result in a reasonable 
              recovery factor, based on volumetrics. Very good suggestions on 
              reconciliation of estimates (simulation, material balance, and decline 
              curve analyses) are provided in reference 2, page V-1531. </p>
            <p>Most computer programs allow multiple forecasts to be made, and 
              sensitivity analysis on the computed variables. If the objective 
              of the forecast is an upside projection, useful in facility design, 
              then harmonic and hyperbolic methods may be employed.</p>
            <p> Also, note that the rate, BOPD, can be MSCF gas. In fields under 
              pump and producing high volumes of water, then a linear relationship 
              between log of water cut and Np would reflect harmonic decline. 
              Linear relationship between water cut and Np would suggest a exponential 
              decline. </p>
